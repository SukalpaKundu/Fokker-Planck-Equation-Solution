# Fokker-Planck-Equation-Solution

This code solves the fokker planck equation in phase space under generic space,time and velocity dependent forcing conditions in phase space and writes the solution in a datafile.

The animations correspond to 
i. Time evolution of the density profile in phase space for a double well potential.
ii. Time evolution of density profile in real space to sinusoidal forcing in a x^4 type potential.
